When interpreting medical data columns like discharge_date, admission_date, diagnosis_date, medication_start_date, and medication_end_date, avoid making specific or strict assumptions about the order of events that might not be universally valid. Instead, only establish general sequences that have broad applicability. For instance, it's universally valid that medication has a start and an end date, so medication_start_date should always be on or before medication_end_date. Similarly, a patient's date of admission should always be before their date of discharge. However, do not make assumptions like diagnosis_date is always before admission_date as this is not universally true. The goal is to capture the broadest and most general sequence of events without being overly prescriptive.\n",
